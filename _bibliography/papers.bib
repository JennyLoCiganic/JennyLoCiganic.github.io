  title={Deprescribing Strategies for Opioids and Benzodiazepines with Emphasis on Concurrent Use: A Scoping Review},

  abstract={While the Food and Drug Administration's black-box warnings caution against concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine (OPI-BZD) use, there is little guidance on how to deprescribe these medications. This scoping review analyzes the available opioid and/or benzodiazepine deprescribing strategies from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases (01/1995-08/2020) and the gray literature. We identified 39 original research studies (opioids: n = 5, benzodiazepines: n = 31, concurrent use: n = 3) and 26 guidelines (opioids: n = 16, benzodiazepines: n = 11, concurrent use: n = 0). Among the three studies deprescribing concurrent use (success rates of 21-100%), two evaluated a 3-week rehabilitation program, and one assessed a 24-week primary care intervention for veterans. Initial opioid dose deprescribing rates ranged from (1) 10-20%/weekday followed by 2.5-10%/weekday over three weeks to (2) 10-25%/1-4 weeks. Initial benzodiazepine dose deprescribing rates ranged from (1) patient-specific reductions over three weeks to (2) 50% dose reduction for 2-4 weeks, followed by 2-8 weeks of dose maintenance and then a 25% reduction biweekly. Among the 26 guidelines identified, 22 highlighted the risks of co-prescribing OPI-BZD, and 4 provided conflicting recommendations on the OPI-BZD deprescribing sequence. Thirty-five states' websites provided resources for opioid deprescription and three states' websites had benzodiazepine deprescribing recommendations. Further studies are needed to better guide OPI-BZD deprescription.},

  title={Concurrent use of prescription gabapentinoids with opioids and risk for fall-related injury among older US Medicare beneficiaries with chronic noncancer pain: A population-based cohort study},
  author={Cheng Chen and Almut G Winterstein and Wei-Hsuan Lo-Ciganic and Patrick J Tighe and Yu-Jung Jenny Wei},
  abstract={We conducted a population-based cohort study using a 5% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries in the United States between 2011 and 2018. Study sample consisted of fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with CNCP diagnosis who initiated opioids. We identified concurrent users with gabapentinoids and opioids days' supply overlapping for ≥1 day and designated first day of concurrency as the index date. We created 2 cohorts based on whether concurrent users initiated gabapentinoids on the day of opioid initiation (Cohort 1) or after opioid initiation (Cohort 2). Each concurrent user was matched to up to 4 opioid-only users on opioid initiation date and index date using risk set sampling. We followed patients from index date to first fall-related injury event ascertained using a validated claims-based algorithm, treatment discontinuation or switching, death, Medicare disenrollment, hospitalization or nursing home admission, or end of study, whichever occurred first. In each cohort, we used propensity score (PS) weighted Cox models to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of fall-related injury, adjusting for year of the index date, sociodemographics, types of chronic pain, comorbidities, frailty, polypharmacy, healthcare utilization, use of nonopioid medications, and opioid use on and before the index date. We identified 6,733 concurrent users and 27,092 matched opioid-only users in Cohort 1 and 5,709 concurrent users and 22,388 matched opioid-only users in Cohort 2. The incidence rate of fall-related injury was 24.5 per 100 person-years during follow-up (median, 9 days; interquartile range [IQR], 5 to 18 days) in Cohort 1 and was 18.0 per 100 person-years during follow-up (median, 9 days; IQR, 4 to 22 days) in Cohort 2. Concurrent users had similar risk of fall-related injury as opioid-only users in Cohort 1(aHR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.34, p = 0.874), but had higher risk for fall-related injury than opioid-only users in Cohort 2 (aHR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.44, p = 0.005). Limitations of this study included confounding due to unmeasured factors, unavailable information on gabapentinoids' indication, potential misclassification, and limited generalizability beyond older adults insured by Medicare FFS program.},

We included adult (≥18 years) patient visits with respiratory-infection-related or non-infection-related cough as reason-for-visit or diagnosis without malignant cancer or benign respiratory tumor diagnoses. Using multivariable logistic regressions, we examined opioid antitussive, benzonatate, dextromethorphan-containing antitussive, and gabapentinoid use trends. From 2003–2005 to 2015–2018, opioid antitussive use decreased in office-based visits (8.8% to 6.4%, Ptrend = 0.03) but remained stable in ED visits (6.3% to 5.9%, Ptrend = 0.99). In both settings, hydrocodone-containing antitussive use declined over 50%. Benzonatate use more than tripled (office-based:1.6% to 4.8%; ED:1.5% to 8.0%; both Ptrend < 0.001). Dextromethorphan-containing antitussive use increased in ED visits (1.8% to 2.6%, Ptrend = 0.003) but stayed unchanged in office-based visits (3.8% to 2.7%; Ptrend = 0.60). Gabapentinoid use doubled in office-based visits (1.1% in 2006–2008 to 2.4% in 2015–2018, Ptrend < 0.001) but was negligible in ED visits. In US office-based and ED ambulatory care settings, hydrocodone-containing antitussive use substantially declined from 2003 to 2018, while benzonatate use more than tripled, and dextromethorphan-containing antitussive and gabapentinoid use remained low (<3%).},

  abstract={We used HCV-TARGET registry data to identify HCV-infected adults receiving all‐oral DAA treatment and having virologic outcome. Potential pretreatment predictors (n = 179) included sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, and virologic data. We applied multivariable logistic regression as well as elastic net, random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and feedforward neural network machine learning algorithms to predict DAA treatment failure. Training (n = 4894) and validation (n = 1631) patient samples had similar sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (mean age, 57 years; 60% male; 66% White; 36% with cirrhosis). Of 6525 HCV‐infected adults, 95.3% achieved sustained virologic response, whereas 4.7% experienced DAA treatment failure. In the validation sample, machine learning approaches performed similarly in predicting DAA treatment failure (C statistic [95% CI]: GBM, 0.69 [0.64–0.74]; random forest, 0.68 [0.63–0.73]; feedforward neural network, 0.66 [0.60–0.71]; elastic net, 0.64 [0.59–0.70]), and all four outperformed multivariable logistic regression (0.51 [0.46–0.57]). Using the Youden index to identify the balanced risk score threshold, GBM had 66.2% sensitivity and 65.1% specificity, and 12 individuals were needed to evaluate to identify 1 DAA treatment failure. Over 55% of patients with treatment failure were classified by the GBM in the top three risk decile subgroups (positive predictive value: 6%–14%). The top 10 GBM‐identified predictors included albumin, liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase), total bilirubin levels, sex, HCV viral loads, sodium level, HCC, platelet levels, and tobacco use.},

  abstract={Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US. Patients with pain conditions have higher suicidal risks. In a systematic review searching observational studies from multiple sources (e.g., MEDLINE) from 1 January 2000-12 September 2020, we evaluated existing suicide prediction models' (SPMs) performance and identified risk factors and their derived data sources among patients with pain conditions. The suicide-related outcomes included suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide deaths, and suicide behaviors. Among the 87 studies included (with 8 SPM studies), 107 suicide risk factors (grouped into 27 categories) were identified. The most frequently occurring risk factor category was depression and their severity (33%). Approximately 20% of the risk factor categories would require identification from data sources beyond structured data (e.g., clinical notes). For 8 SPM studies (only 2 performing validation), the reported prediction metrics/performance varied: C-statistics (n = 3 studies) ranged 0.67-0.84, overall accuracy(n = 5): 0.78-0.96, sensitivity(n = 2): 0.65-0.91, and positive predictive values(n = 3): 0.01-0.43. Using the modified Quality in Prognosis Studies tool to assess the risk of biases, four SPM studies had moderate-to-high risk of biases. This systematic review identified a comprehensive list of risk factors that may improve predicting suicidal risks for patients with pain conditions. Future studies need to examine reasons for performance variations and SPM's clinical utility.},

  title={Readmission Prediction for Patients with Heterogeneous Medical History: A Trajectory-Based Deep Learning Approach},
  author={Jiaheng Xie and Bin Zhang and Jian Ma and Daniel Zeng and Jenny Lo-Ciganic},
  abstract={Hospital readmission refers to the situation where a patient is re-hospitalized with the same primary diagnosis within a specific time interval after discharge. Hospital readmission causes $26 billion preventable expenses to the U.S. health systems annually and often indicates suboptimal patient care. To alleviate those severe financial and health consequences, it is crucial to proactively predict patients’ readmission risk. Such prediction is challenging because the evolution of patients’ medical history is dynamic and complex. The state-of-the-art studies apply statistical models which use static predictors in a period, failing to consider patients’ heterogeneous medical history. Our approach – Trajectory-BAsed DEep Learning (TADEL) – is motivated to tackle the deficiencies of the existing approaches by capturing dynamic medical history. We evaluate TADEL on a five-year national Medicare claims dataset including 3.6 million patients per year over all hospitals in the United States, reaching an F1 score of 87.3% and an AUC of 88.4%. Our approach significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that health status factors and insurance coverage are important predictors for readmission. This study contributes to IS literature and analytical methodology by formulating the trajectory-based readmission prediction problem and developing a novel deep-learning-based readmission risk prediction framework. From a health IT perspective, this research delivers implementable methods to assess patients’ readmission risk and take early interventions to avoid potential negative consequences.},

  abstract={We examined trends in management of headache disorders in United States (US) emergency department (ED) visits. We conducted a cross-sectional study using 2007−2018 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data. We included adult patient visits (≥18 years) with a primary ED discharge diagnosis of headache. We classified headache medications by pharmacological group: opioids, butalbital, ergot alkaloids/triptans, acetaminophen/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antiemetics, diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, and intravenous fluids. To obtain reliable estimates, we aggregated data into three time periods: 2007−2010, 2011−2014, and 2015−2018. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined medication, neuroimaging, and outpatient referral trends, separately. Among headache-related ED visits, opioid use decreased from 54.1% in 2007−2010 to 28.3% in 2015−2018 (Ptrend < 0.001). There were statistically significant increasing trends in acetaminophen/NSAIDs, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids use (all Ptrend < 0.001). Changes in butalbital (6.4%), ergot alkaloid/triptan (4.7%), antiemetic (59.2% in 2015−2018), and neuroimaging (37.3%) use over time were insignificant. Headache-related ED visits with outpatient referral for follow-up increased slightly from 73.3% in 2007−2010 to 79.7% in 2015−2018 (Ptrend = 0.02). Reflecting evidence-based guideline recommendations for headache management, opioid use substantially decreased from 2007 to 2018 among US headache-related ED visits. Future studies are warranted to identify strategies to promote evidence-based treatment for headaches (e.g., sumatriptan, dexamethasone) and appropriate outpatient referral and reduce unnecessary neuroimaging orders in EDs.},

Effective strategies for retaining persons on MOUD, an essential step to improving outcomes, are needed as roughly half of all persons initiating MOUD discontinue within a year. Data science may be valuable and promising for improving MOUD retention by using "big data" (e.g., electronic health record data, claims data mobile/sensor data, social media data) and specific machine learning techniques (e.g., predictive modeling, natural language processing, reinforcement learning) to individualize patient care. Maximizing the utility of data science to improve MOUD retention requires a three-pronged approach: (1) increasing funding for data science research for OUD, (2) integrating data from multiple sources including treatment for OUD and general medical care as well as data not specific to medical care (e.g., mobile, sensor, and social media data), and (3) applying multiple data science approaches with integrated big data to provide insights and optimize advances in the OUD and overall addiction fields.},

Using group-based multitrajectory modeling, this study identified patients' distinct opioid and gabapentinoid (OPI-GABA) dose and duration patterns, based on standardized daily doses, within a year of initiating opioids and/or gabapentinoids. Concurrent direct medical expenditures within the same year were estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighted multivariable generalized linear regression, adjusting for sociodemographic and health status factors.},

METHODS: Pharmacy claims from July 2017 to June 2019 were analyzed from a private health plan serving a large Florida employer. We summed the number of units and the total MMEs dispensed for each month per 1,000 enrollees. Units were defined as the total quantity of tablets/capsules dispensed for each Schedule II oral opioid prescription. We used interrupted time series (ITS) models, accounting for autocorrelation, to determine any immediate change after the policy implementation and to estimate trends before and after the policy.},

  abstract={Health system data incompletely capture the social risk factors for drug overdose. This study aimed to improve the accuracy of a machine-learning algorithm to predict opioid overdose risk by integrating human services and criminal justice data with health claims data to capture the social determinants of overdose risk. This prognostic study included Medicaid beneficiaries (n = 237,259) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania enrolled between 2015 and 2018, randomly divided into training, testing, and validation samples. We measured 290 potential predictors (239 derived from Medicaid claims data) in 30-day periods, beginning with the first observed Medicaid enrollment date during the study period. Using a gradient boosting machine, we predicted a composite outcome (i.e., fatal or nonfatal opioid overdose constructed using medical examiner and claims data) in the subsequent month. We compared prediction performance between a Medicaid claims only model to one integrating human services and criminal justice data with Medicaid claims (i.e., integrated model) using several metrics (e.g., C-statistic, number needed to evaluate [NNE] to identify one overdose). Beneficiaries were stratified into risk-score decile subgroups. The samples (training = 79,087, testing = 79,086, validation = 79,086) had similar characteristics (age = 38±18 years, female = 56%, white = 48%, having at least one overdose = 1.7% during study period). Using the validation sample, the integrated model slightly improved on the Medicaid claims only model (C-statistic = 0.885; 95%CI = 0.877-0.892 vs. C-statistic = 0.871; 95%CI = 0.863-0.878), with small corresponding improvements in the NNE and positive predictive value. Nine of the top 30 most important predictors in the integrated model were human services and criminal justice variables. Using the integrated model, approximately 70% of individuals with overdoses were members of the top risk decile (overdose rates in the subsequent month = 47/10,000 beneficiaries). Few individuals in the bottom 9 deciles had overdose episodes (0-12/10,000). Machine-learning algorithms integrating claims and social service and criminal justice data modestly improved opioid overdose prediction among Medicaid beneficiaries for a large U.S. county heavily affected by the opioid crisis},

  abstract={We examined the prevalence trends of non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sexually transmitted infections (STI) and associated patient characteristics in U.S. ambulatory-care settings from 2005-2016. We conducted a retrospective repeated cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for individuals aged 15-64 with a non-HIV STI-related visit. Data were combined into three periods (2005-2008, 2009-2012, and 2013-2016) to obtain reliable estimates. Logistic regression was used for analysis. A total of 19.5 million weighted, non-HIV STI-related ambulatory visits from 2005-2016 were identified. STI-related visits per 100,000 ambulatory care visits increased significantly over the study period: 206 (95% CI = 153-259), 343 (95% CI = 279-407), and 361 (95% CI = 277-446) in 2005-2008, 2009-2012, and 2013-2016, respectively (Ptrend = 0.003). These increases were mainly driven by increases in HPV-related visits (56 to 163 per 100,000 visits) from 2005-2008 to 2009-2012, followed by syphilis- or gonorrhea-related visits (30 to 67 per 100,000 visits) from 2009-2012 to 2013-2016. Higher odds of having STI-related visit were associated with younger age (aged 15-24: aOR = 4.45; 95% CI = 3.19-6.20 and aged 25-44: aOR = 3.59; 95% CI = 2.71-4.77) vs. 45-64-year-olds, Black race (aOR = 2.41; 95% CI = 1.78-3.25) vs. White, and HIV diagnosis (aOR = 10.60; 95% CI = 5.50-20.27) vs. no HIV diagnosis. STI-related office visits increased by over 75% from 2005-2016, and were largely driven by HPV-related STIs and syphilis- or gonorrhea-related STIs.},

  abstract={Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy may prevent breast cancer recurrence, however, adverse effects may lead to treatment discontinuation. Evidence regarding the occurrence of AI-associated musculoskeletal problems among Asians is scarce. We identified women with breast cancer-initiating tamoxifen or AIs from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2007-2012). Using multivariable cause-specific hazard models, we examined the association between endocrine therapy and the risk of any arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome, adjusting for age, prior cancer treatment, and other health status factors. Among 32,055 eligible women with breast cancer (mean age = 52.6 ± 11.5 years), 87.4% initiated tamoxifen, 3.9% initiated anastrozole, 8.0% initiated letrozole, and 0.7% initiated exemestane. AI users had a higher 1-year cumulative incidence for any arthritis (13.0% vs. 8.2%, p < 0.0001) and carpal tunnel syndrome (1.4% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.008). Compared to tamoxifen users, AI users had a higher risk of any arthritis [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.21, 95%CI = 1.09-1.34] and carpal tunnel syndrome (aHR = 1.68, 95%CI = 1.22-2.32). No significant difference was observed in the risks of any arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome across different AIs. Taxane use was not associated with any arthritis (aHR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.81-1.05) or carpal tunnel syndrome (aHR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.67-1.40) compared to other chemotherapies.

  author={Joshua D Brown and Wei-Hsuan Lo-Ciganic and Hui Shao and Marco Pahor and Todd M Manini},
  abstract={Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) assessment is a widely used measure of lower extremity function, strength, and balance. In the Lifestyles Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study, baseline SPPB and changes throughout the trial were strongly associated with major mobility disability (MMD). This study further investigated this association by identifying trajectories of SPPB and evaluating the predictive validity of SPPB trajectories for future MMD. Participants (n = 1635) aged 70-89 years were randomized to a physical activity or health education intervention and assessed every 6 months for MMD. We used group-based trajectory models (GBTMs) to identify trajectories of a binary outcome for a decrease from baseline SPPB of ≥1. Multinomial logistic regression explored baseline factors associated with group membership. Survival analyses evaluated the association between trajectories with MMD. The GBTM identified a 3-group model which included a "No Decline" group (46.0%), "Late Decline" group (27.7%), and an "Early Decline" group (26.3%). Adjusting for all other baseline characteristics, group assignment during the previous follow-up visit was strongly associated with MMD at the subsequent period. Comparisons between groups showed a 2-to-3-fold increase in MMD comparing the "Late" to "No" decline group and a 4-to-5-fold increase in MMD comparing the "Early" to "No" decline group. Group membership and impact on MMD was not different between intervention arms. Group-based trajectories of SPPB scores identified distinct subgroups in LIFE Study participants. Using these group assignments in outcome models were highly associated with MMD. GBTMs have potential to identify and improve prediction of aging-related decline to better design and identify patients for interventions.},

  abstract={Increasing gabapentinoid use has raised concerns of misuse and abuse in the United States (US). Little is known about the characteristics of gabapentinoid use in general clinical practice over time. This cross-sectional study used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. We examined the trends of patient and prescriber characteristics and the diagnoses associated with US ambulatory care visits involving gabapentinoids for adult visits from 2003 to 2016. Using multivariable logistic regression, we estimated the adjusted proportion of gabapentinoid-involved visits among all visits and tested for trend significance. Among the weighted estimate of 260.1 million gabapentinoid-involved visits (aged 18-64 years: 61.8%; female: 61.9%; white: 85.5%), the adjusted annual proportion of gabapentinoid-involved visits nearly quadrupled from 2003 to 2016 (9.1 to 34.9 per 1000 visits; Ptrend < 0.0001), driven mainly by gabapentin. Nearly half had concurrent use with opioids (32.9%) or benzodiazepines (15.3%). Primary care physicians (45.8%), neurologists (8.2%), surgeons (6.2%), and psychiatrists (4.8%) prescribed two-thirds of the gabapentinoids. Most (96.6%) of the gabapentinoid visits did not have an approved indication for gabapentinoids among the first three diagnoses. Among US ambulatory care visits from 2003 to 2016, gabapentinoid use increased substantially, commonly prescribed by primary care physicians.},

  abstract={Although physicians learn about new medical technologies from their peers, the magnitude and source of peer influence is unknown. We estimate the effect of peer adoption of three first-in-class medications (dabigatran, sitigliptin, and aliskiren) on physicians' own adoption of those medications. We included 11,958 physicians in Pennsylvania prescribing anticoagulant, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive medications. We constructed 4 types of peer networks based on shared Medicare and Medicaid patients, medical group affiliation, hospital affiliation, and medical school/residency training. Instrumental variables analysis was used to estimate the causal effect of peer adoption (fraction of peers in each network adopting the new drug) on physician adoption (prescribing at least the median number prescriptions within 15 months of the new drug's introduction). We illustrate how physician network position can inform targeting of interventions to physicians by computing a social multiplier. Dabigatran was adopted by 25.2%, sitagliptin by 24.5% and aliskiren by 8.3% of physicians. A 10-percentage point increase in peer adoption in the patient-sharing network led to a 5.90% (SE = 1.50%, p<0.001) increase in physician adoption of dabigatran, 8.32% (SE = 1.51%, p<0.001) increase in sitagliptin, and 7.84% increase in aliskiren adoption (SE = 2.93%, p<0.001). Peer effects through shared hospital affiliation were positive but not significant, and medical group and training network effects were not reliably estimated. Physicians in the top decile of patient-sharing network peers were estimated to have nearly 2-fold stronger influence on their peers' adoption compared to physicians in the top decile of prescribing volume. Limitations include lack of detailed clinical information and pharmaceutical promotion, variables which may influence physician adoption but which are unlikely to bias our peer effect estimates. Peer adoption, especially by those with whom physicians share patients, strongly influenced physician adoption of new drugs. Our study shows the potential for using information on physician peer networks to improve technology diffusion.},

  abstract={Health insurance claims data may play an important role for health care systems and payers in monitoring the nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NMPO) among patients. However, these systems require valid methods for identifying NMPO if they are to target individuals for intervention. Limited efforts have been made to define NMPO using administrative data available to health systems and payers. We conducted a systematic review of publications that defined and measured NMPO within health insurance claims databases in order to describe definitions of NMPO and identify areas for improvement.},

  abstract={Genital powder use has been associated with risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in some, but not all, epidemiologic investigations, possibly reflecting the carcinogenic effects of talc particles found in most of these products. Whether risk increases with number of genital powder applications and for all histologic types of ovarian cancer also remains uncertain. Therefore, we estimated the association between self-reported genital powder use and epithelial ovarian cancer risk in eight population-based case-control studies. Individual data from each study were collected and harmonized. Lifetime number of genital powder applications was estimated from duration and frequency of use. Pooled ORs were calculated using conditional logistic regression matched on study and age and adjusted for potential confounders. Subtype-specific risks were estimated according to tumor behavior and histology. 8,525 cases and 9,859 controls were included in the analyses. Genital powder use was associated with a modest increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer [OR, 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-1.33] relative to women who never used powder. Risk was elevated for invasive serous (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32), endometrioid (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.43), and clear cell (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.52) tumors, and for borderline serous tumors (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24-1.72). Among genital powder users, we observed no significant trend (P = 0.17) in risk with increasing number of lifetime applications (assessed in quartiles). We noted no increase in risk among women who only reported nongenital powder use. In summary, genital powder use is a modifiable exposure associated with small-to-moderate increases in risk of most histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer.},
